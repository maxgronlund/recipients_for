-----------------------------------------
Custom ontroller
When you attach a message to a model instance you have to create a controller for that.
In the controller for the view where you want the message system to apear
include the following


    include Message::MessageServices
    include Message::ReaderServices

    def new
      build_message
      set_recipients
    end

    def create
      @message_subject = create_message(
          author: current_user,
          messageable: @schedule,
          personas: @schedule.approved_persons,
          params: message_subject_params
        )
      if @message_subject.persisted?
        redirect_to ffa_course_course_schedule_course_attendance_mails_path(@course, @schedule)
      else
        set_recipients
        render :new
      end
    end


You also have to create two private method like this

    private

    def set_recipients
      find_or_create_receipients(
        messageble: INSTANCE_THE_MESSAGES_ARE_ATTACHED_TO,
        personas: LIST_OF_POTENTIAL_MESSAGE_RECIVERS,
        notifications: [
          {notification_type: "email", name: "email", checked: true, internal: false},
          {notification_type: "internal", name: "intern besked", checked: false, internal: true}
        ]
      )
    end

    def message_subject_params
      params.require(:message_subject).permit!
    end

where
*   messageble: is what you want the message to be about. e.g. a house, a person, anything you like
*   personas: is a list op potential readers of the message whom can be selected/deselected from the new view by the sender
*   notifications: is a list of hashes of options the sender can celect
        * notification_type: is the internal type it will be passed back to the rails ap when a message is send
        * name: is the translation of the message_type used to presend the name to the sender
        * checked: is the default value for the checkboxes where the sende select recivers for a message
        * internal: is if the message should show up in the internal system





-----------------------------------------
Views (haml)
You can write your own views for attaching messages

new

    = render "message/messages/form",
      message_subject: @message_subject,
      message_content: @message_content,
      messageble: @messageble,
      personas: @personas,
      controller: "NAME_OF_YOUR_CUSTOM_CONTROLLER"

    = render "message/recipients_list" , recipients: @recipients, messageble: @messageble


controller is the controller thats handle the post message when the user creates the message
controller: e.g. 'cars' will bounche back to cars_controller.rb
"message/recipients_list" is optional
